#Q1 Given an array of numbers, write a function that prints in the console another arraywhich contains
# all the even numbers in the original array, which also have even indexes only.
#     ○ Test 1: getOnlyEvens([1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8]) prints [ 4]
#     ○ Test 2: getOnlyEvens([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) prints [0, 2, 4]

#Q2 Create a function that takes a two-digit number as an parameter and prints "Ok" inthe console 
#if the given string is greater than its reversed digit version. If not, the function will print "Not ok"
#  ○ Test 1: reverseCompare(72) prints "ok" because 72 > 27

#Q3 Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the factorial of the number.
# Notes: The factorial of 0 is 1. Ex: factorial seven is : 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. 
# The factorial of any positive integer x is x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * . . . . . . * 1 
# (ex: factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)
#    ○ Test 1: returnFactorial(5) outputs 120
#    ○ Test 2: returnFactorial(6) outputs 720
#    ○ Test 3: returnFactorial(0) outputs 1

#Q4  A Meera array is defined to be an array containing only numbers as its elements and forall n values in the array,
# the value n*2 is not in the array. So [3, 5, -2] is a Meera array because 3*2, 5*2 or 2*2 are not in the array.
# But [8, 3, 4] is not a Meera array because 2*4=8 and both 4 and 8 are elements found in the array.
# Write a function that takes an array of numbered elements and prints “I am a Meera array” in the console
# if its array does NOT contain n and also n*2 as value. Otherwise, the function prints “I am NOT a Meera array”
#     ○ Test 1: checkMeera([10, 4, 0, 5]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because 5 * 2 is 10
#     ○ Test 2: checkMeera([7, 4, 9]) outputs “I am a Meera array”
#     ○ Test 1: checkMeera([1, -6, 4, -3]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because -3 *2 is -6

#Q5 Define a Dual array to be an array where every value occurs exactly twice.
# For example, {1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2} is a dual array.The following arrays are not Dual arrays {2, 5, 2, 5, 5} 
#(5 occurs three times instead of two times) {3, 1, 1, 2, 2} (3 occurs once instead of two
#times) Write a function named isDual that returns 1 if its array argument is a Dual array.
#Otherwise it returns 0.

#Q6 Write a function that takes the number of seconds and returns the digital format clock time as a string.
# Time should be counted from 00:00:00.
#  ○ Examples: digitalClock(5025) as "01:23:45" 5025 seconds is 1 hour, 23 mins, 45secs.
#      ■ digitalClock(61201) as "17:00:01" No AM/PM. 24h format.
#      ■ digitalClock(87000) as "00:10:00" It's 00:10 next day.

    hours = (seconds // 3600) % 24
